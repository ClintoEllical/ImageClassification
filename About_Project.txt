This is the file for describing the detail of the project
Create a project with classification models.
This project can be used on the data which is going to be used in object detection
We can use this project and specifically certain models mentioned for pre-processing the dataset.

Classification models

0-Cars 
dataset: kaggle,google images
purpose: to get images which has cars.

1-Blur Detection Model
Dataset: kaggle images converted to gausian blur with opencv2.
Purpose: To filter out blur images from dataset.preproseccing of dataset

2-Motion Blur Detection Model
Dataset : kaggle images 
Purpose : To filter out motion blur images can be used in preprosessing.

3-Noise classification Model
Dataset : kaggle
Purpose : to filter out noice images

4=Dark images classification Model
Dataset: kaggle
purpose: to filter dark images from the dataset


FUTURE TRIES
Overexposure Detection Model
Empty Image Detection Model
Camera Distortion or Lens Artifact Detection Model
pretrained model for filtering duplicate images
